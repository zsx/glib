/* This is a repackaging of win_iconv by Yukihiro Nakadaira. The
 * actual source code in win_iconv.c is by him. I just added some
 * small bits: this trivial iconv.h header, the win_iconv_dll.c
 * wrapper that makes it possible to build win_iconv.c into a DLL that
 * has the same API and ABI as GNU libiconv, the Makefile.
